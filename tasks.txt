Current workflow idea:
1. User logs in, gets redirected to portfolio management panel
2. User manages their portfolio (upload pictures, set background color, set display layout, etc.)
3. User saves changes, backend updates database and saves images (maybe do some resizing for optimal page load times?)
4. User shares link to portfolio so the public can access their work

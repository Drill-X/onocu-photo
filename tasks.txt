 - What would even go here? 

--- Portfolio Display ---
Path: <base>/portfolio/<user>
Description: Displays the user's portfolio (publicly, no login needed)
TODO: 
 - Controller
 - Views
 - Portfolio database model (read)

--- Admin Panel ---
Path: <base>/admin/
Description: A basic user management panel
 - Add, list, remove normal users

--- Portfolio Management Panel ---
Path: <base>/manage/<user>


Current workflow idea:
1. User logs in, gets redirected to portfolio management panel
2. User manages their portfolio (upload pictures, set background color, set display layout, etc.)
3. User saves changes, backend updates database and saves images (maybe do some resizing for optimal page load times?)
4. User shares link to portfolio so the public can access their work

Login/logout/auth stuff (the main work here was configuring it to use username instead of email for login; shield does all the hard work)
